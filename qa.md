# QA Challenge

## About the challenge


We don't want our customers to have problems and bugs while using our platform, Zé Delivery. Specially in this super important moment, which is when he chooses a cold beer to enjoy it right away.

Well, having that in mind, we must implement a few tests to minimize this risk:

To develop the code challenge, please use our platforms:
- [Zé Delivery Web](https://www.ze.delivery/)
- [Zé Delivery Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerveceriamodelo.modelonow&hl=pt_BR)
- [Zé Delivery iOS](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z%C3%A9-delivery/id1070070438)


### 1. Identify critical flows

You'll notice that our web and mobile platforms are a bit different, so for this first part of the code challenge, you can choose one of the 3 applications we have: Android, iOS, Web.

Identify, define and describe 3 important flows that keep the application working properly. Explain why you chose those 3 flows.


### 2. UI automation test

##### Web automated test
In our [Web application](https://www.ze.delivery/) create an automation test suite to a scenario you feel is more important to keep the application working properly.

##### Mobile automated test
In our Mobile application, choose one of the apps [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cerveceriamodelo.modelonow&hl=pt_BR) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/z%C3%A9-delivery/id1070070438).
Create an automation test suite to a scenario you feel is more important to keep the application working properly.

### 3. API automation test

We're looking for an automation test suite for an open API with ATDD approach or similar.
Create automated tests to get weather using Open Weather API

### Final considerations

To create the tests above, you can choose any programming language, framework etc you feel more comfortable.
Please provide a document as a summary with the guidelines of the taken approach and the made decisions (e.g selection criteria for language, framework, etc.).
Don't forget to provide a detailed documentation on how to install and run the tests.

When you're done, please send your solution to a public GIT repository and send us the link.

This test will be evaluated by ZX-Ventures Engineering team.

If you're having any issues with the challenge, feel free to contact us.
Good Luck!
