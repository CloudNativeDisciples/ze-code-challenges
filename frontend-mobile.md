# Frontend/Mobile Challenge

## About the Challenge 

We're using GraphQL here (take a look at https://www.graphql.com/guides/), so that's gonna be the way you're going to receive the data (sounds good, right?).

### What you should develop?
It's simple. The user needs to type an address inside a field and be redirected to a products list page. So your job as a front-end engineer will be to create 2 simple screens consuming and sending data to our API.

You can check out an example of this flow at: https://ze.delivery/ (our production env)

### Visual
We want you to feel free to develop the markup the way you want, we have no wireframes or something like that for this task. You will create 2 screens:
  - Home page:
    - Needs to have a header, a footer and a input for the user to fill up with the address.
  - Products page:
    - We want to see the products as cards, with the product title, price and buttons to add/remove the product.

### About the API
The API link that you will use: https://api.code-challenge.ze.delivery/public/graphql 
(If you open it in the browser it will appear "Missing Authentication Token", you need use it in code)
  - Home page:
    - To find the latitude and longitude of an address, you can use Google Maps API or use any other Geocoder API that you feel comfortable with.
    - Use the following address to find a distributor (PoC):  Rua AmeÃÅrico Brasiliense, SaÃÉo Paulo . 
    - The Query needed to get the right distributor (get the first distributor):
        - Query: https://bit.ly/32Gb2Qi
        - Arguments:
          - Algorithm: "NEAREST".
          - Lat: Use as String.
          - Long: Use as String.
          - Now: Pass the current Date formatted.
  - Products page:
      - The Query needed to get the products
        - Query: https://bit.ly/2N3JQ7k
        - Arguments:
          - Id: id of the distributor retrieved from the previous query (PocSearch).
          - Search: if "" (empty), does not filter by search.
          - CategoryId: if null, does not filter by category.
      - The Query needed to get the category list
        - Query: https://bit.ly/2pMG8Xy


### Tech Requirements (for both positions):
- You need to create a repo on GitHub to host your code
  - Github users:
      - @ze-engineering-code-challenge
- Avoid using scaffolds (Create React App etc.), we want to see how you make your project structure
- Keep it simple, no need for fancy stuff :)
- TESTS üíõ We really love testing our code and features here!

#### If you are running for a front-end position:
- You're not allowed to use any CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Bulma, PureCSS etc.)
- React will be a plus, but you can use whatever you want =)
- I want to be able to run your project locally by using `npm start`

#### If you are running for a mobile position:
- You should use React Native to develop your application
- I want to be able to run your project with one single command
- Hosting it its a BIG plus (Expo should do the job for you)

## Evaluation Method

Your code will be under review of the Z√© Engineering team. What we will look for:
- **Good Practices and patterns**
- **Code and Folder Structure**
- **Componentization and data flow**
- **Easy to understand code (again, no need for fancy stuff)**
- **TESTS**

Feel free to implement it the way you feel more confortable :)

## How to deliver it

Please, use Github to host your code and add @ze-engineering-code-challenge as a collaborator for it. This Github account (@ze-engineering-code-challenge) is solely used by Z√©'s engineers to download your code and review it

**Once you have finished the challenge, please follow these [instructions](https://github.com/ZXVentures/ze-code-challenges#how-to-deliver).**
